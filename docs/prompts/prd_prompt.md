**Content Synthesis**: After each response, provide:
1. Bullet-pointed section content (no prose paragraphs)
2. Identification of any missing critical information
3. Confirmation of section completion before proceeding

**Validation Checkpoints**: Before advancing sections, confirm:
- All requirements are testable
